The solution involves using file locking to serialize access to the counter.  This ensures that only one thread can access and modify the counter at any given time, preventing the race condition.  Here's the corrected code:

```php
<?php

$counterFile = 'counter.txt';

function updateCounter() {
  global $counterFile;
  // Acquire an exclusive lock on the counter file
  $fp = fopen($counterFile, 'c+');
  if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {
    $counter = (int)file_get_contents($counterFile);
    $counter++;
    ftruncate($fp, 0);
    rewind($fp);
    fwrite($fp, $counter);
    fflush($fp);
    flock($fp, LOCK_UN);
  }
  fclose($fp);
}

// Example usage
updateCounter();
echo file_get_contents($counterFile);
?>
```

This revised code uses `flock` to acquire an exclusive lock before accessing and modifying the counter.  The lock ensures that only one process can update the counter at a time, solving the race condition and ensuring accurate results.
